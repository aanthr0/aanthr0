## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.
I'm very interested and am currently experimenting in making my own website (you can check out the progress [here](https://github.com/aanthr0/personal-website "Personal Website"))

My latest project is a Discord bot called Sine Wave, which plays a 3600Hz sine wave sound in your voice channel when you mention it.
Right now, I'm not working on anything as I'm trying to find a good idea for something to make.
I'm also learning HTML & CSS, and have made my own [website](https://aanthr0.is-a.dev/).
I would love to explore the topics of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but right now I don't have the time to do so.
