## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.
I'm very interested and am currently experimenting in making my own website (you can check out the progress [here](https://github.com/aanthr0/personal-website "Personal Website"))

My latest project is a Discord bot called Sine Wave, which plays a 3600Hz sine wave sound in your voice channel when you mention it.
Currently, I'm working on a bot called Onyx. Onyx is a guild manager for the Discord server of my organization, [Onyx Developments](https://github.com/onyx-developments).
I'm also learning HTML & CSS, and have made my own [website](http://na1.bluefoxhost.com:8215), which I plan on updating when I get a mail server.
