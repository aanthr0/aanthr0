## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.
I'm currently majoring in computer science and am very interested in learning Web Development.

My last project was the (now defunct) Discord bot called "Frederick", and I'm currently working on a CLI-based password manager (why would you trust other people when you can trust yourself amirite).

Regarding programming, I mostly use JavaScript and I'm very familiar with Python.
I'd like to learn HTML and CSS to experiment with and make websites of my own.

## Contact me
If you'd like to contact me for whatever reason, you can do so on my Discord account ([hover here](https://discord.com/ "aanthr0#5169")) or my email address ([hover here](https://mail.google.com/ "anthromadayt@gmail.com")) (please mention you're coming from GitHub).
