## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.
I'm John, and I have no clue what I'm doing.
In my free time, I like to turn my incredibly dumb ideas into reality with JavaScript.
I'd like to explore the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and because of [a certain TV show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/), my dream is to make [something like this](https://personofinterest.fandom.com/wiki/The_Machine)

## Projects
My last project was [eval-bot](https://github.com/aanthr0/eval-bot), a Discord bot with the sole purpose of bringing the eval command with you. It was based on my [template discord.js bot](https://github.com/aanthr0/djs-template), the project before eval-bot.
The template was designed to be used to make your own Discord bot without the hassle of creating a command handler and cluttering your main bot file with events.
Before those, I was (and still am) interested in website development, so I decided to make [my own website](https://github.com/aanthr0/personal-website), which I don't keep up anymore because I don't like the look of it. I plan to remake the website, but probably not anytime soon.
When I finished my website, I decided to make a joke project shortly after. It was another Discord bot called [Sine Wave](https://github.com/aanthr0/sine-wave) which played [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0-c4l_tcTQ) in your voice channel after you mentioned it.

Currently, I'm not working on anything, and I'm trying to find decent project ideas to work on.
