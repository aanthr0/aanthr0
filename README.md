## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.

## Projects
Currently, I am working on a package for Discord bots that makes it easy to create an eval command.

My last project was a bot called Sine Wave which played [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0-c4l_tcTQ&ab_channel=Ryen) in your voice channel when you mentioned it.
Sadly, that bot is not up anymore, but if you want, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/aanthr0/sine-wave) and host it yourself!
Apologies if the code is a bit hard to read, I didn't really feel the need to make the code look nice because it's a single file bot.

## Hosting solution
Do you need a hosting service to run your bot or website on?
Check out [BlueFox Host](https://bluefoxhost.com/) for cheap hosting with extremely high performance!
