## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.
I'm John, and I have no clue what I'm doing.
In my free time, I like to turn my incredibly dumb ideas into reality with JavaScript.
I'd like to explore the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and because of [a certain TV show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/), my dream is to make [something like this](https://personofinterest.fandom.com/wiki/The_Machine).

## Projects
I am currently working on my own personal website, the files of which you can find [here](https://www.github.com/aanthr0/personal-website).
I'm also working on another project, called [Shackholder](https://github.com/aanthr0/shackholder), which is a guild manager bot for my upcoming Discord server.
My last project was a template Discord bot, which is still being in the works as there are some missing features.
Prior to the template, I made a joke Discord bot called [Sine Wave](https://www.github.com/aanthr0/sine-wave), which played [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0-c4l_tcTQ&ab_channel=Ryen) in your voice call when you mentioned it.

## Hosting solution
Do you need a hosting service to run your bot or website on?
Check out [BlueFox Host](https://bluefoxhost.com/) for cheap hosting with extremely high performance!
