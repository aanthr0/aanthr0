## About me
Hey! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thanks for visiting.
I'm very interested and am currently experimenting in making my own website (you can check out the progress [here](https://github.com/aanthr0/personal-website "Personal Website"))

My last project was the (now defunct) Discord bot called "Frederick", which I plan on reviving sometime soon.
Regarding programming, I mostly use JavaScript and I'm very familiar with Python.
I'd like to learn HTML and CSS to experiment with and make websites of my own.
